Expo Link: https://expo.io/@colleague147/Colleague

## Operating Instructions
This prototype was developed for iPhone 7 using `React Native` and `Expo`.
Follow the steps below to download and run our prototype:
1. Install the `Expo` Client app onto your phone from the App Store.
2. Install `Node 10 LTS` or greater for your platform if you don’t have it already.
3. Download the `zip` file of our Colleague prototype from our website.
4. Unzip the file.
5. Open a terminal.
6. Install expo by typing `npm install -g expo-cli` if you don’t have it
installed already.
7. In your terminal, navigate to the unzipped folder you downloaded.
8. Type `npm install` to install the necessary node modules for the project.
9. Make sure that your computer and phone are on the same Wi-Fi.
10.Type `expo start` to start `Expo`. A QR code will be printed in the terminal.
Scan the QR code from your iPhone camera app. Click on the “open in Expo”
banner at the top of your screen to open the app in `Expo`.
11.The app should now be opened in `Expo` showing our Home Page.
When you run the app, you might get warnings at the bottom of certain pages. You can
safely ignore them by hitting the ‘Dismiss’ button.

## Limitations
Due to the time constraints, we chose to simplify certain features of our app:
* All user profiles, resources, talks, and articles are fake data points and are
hard-coded.
* Users are not able to upload a file using the upload page. However, they are
allowed to go through the motions of filling out a title and description as if they
were uploading a file.
* Browse categories are displayed on the home page, but clicking on them
wouldn’t do anything.

We omitted the following features that would be implemented in the final version of our
app:
* A login feature and sign up feature. Currently the user is already logged in.
* Being able to save a resource by hitting a bookmark icon on thumbnails.
* An onboarding tutorial explaining the different types of content that can be
uploaded.
* A fully-functional browsing feature.
